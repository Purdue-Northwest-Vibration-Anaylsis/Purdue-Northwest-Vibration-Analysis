# Purdue-Northwest-Vibration-Analysis
Vibration analysis senior design project for Purdue Northwest.

# Background
Reactive maintenance of any sort of machinery/appliance is almost always more costly than preventative maintenance. Industries, such as the steel industry for example, have been investing in monitoring equipment on their machinery to identify and fix issues before they cause a total breakdown. Individual consumers do not yet have this luxury, so oftentimes their appliances completely break before they are aware of an issue.

# Objective
The open vibration analysis project seeks to prevent reactive maintenance of consumer appliances and instead allow the owners to perform preventative maintenance. Reactive maintenance, which is fixing the problem after it breaks down, is almost always more costly and time consuming than preventative maintenance, which is fixing a problem before it results in a complete breakdown. Our device would identify when there is a problem before it causes a breakdown.

# Approach
The vibration analysis device would work by being attached to the consumer appliance, let’s say a washing machine for this example. It would use a combination of an accelerometer, to measure vibration, and some sort of contact microphone, to measure sound, and it would use a program to identify an average range of vibrations/noise. Once the appliance starts to vibrate abnormally or starts producing unusual noises, the device would alert the user that something is malfunctioning in the appliance.

# Outcome
The anticipated outcome is a relatively small device, around 5”x5”, that can easily be attached to a consumer appliance, connected to a power supply, and easily configured with a user-friendly software. This software could connect to a phone and send notification alerts when the device senses abnormalities in the appliance. The device would ideally serve a wide range of consumers and work with most home appliances, such as washing/drying machines, refrigerators, AC units, and more.
