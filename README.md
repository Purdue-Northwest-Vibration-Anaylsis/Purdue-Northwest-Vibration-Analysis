# Purdue-Northwest-Vibration-Analysis
Vibration analysis senior design project for Purdue Northwest.

# Background
Household appliances breaking down is a costly issue for everyday consumers. 
There are typically two options when an appliance breaks down: reactive maintenance or buying a replacement, both of which are extremely costly. Proactive maintenance, as opposed to reactive maintenance, is identifying and fixing the issue before it results in a breakdown. Industries, such as the steel industry for example, have been investing in monitoring equipment on their machinery to identify and fix issues before they cause a total breakdown. Individual consumers do not yet have this luxury, so oftentimes their appliances completely break before they are aware of an issue.


# Objective
The open vibration analysis project seeks to prevent reactive maintenance of consumer appliances and instead allow the owners to perform proactive maintenance. Reactive maintenance, which is fixing the problem after it breaks down, is almost always more costly and time consuming than proactive maintenance, which is fixing a problem before it results in a complete breakdown. The objective of this project is to build a device that would be able to identify the problem before it results in a breakdown and alert the consumer to fix it. This would save the consumer money and reduce downtime. 

# Approach
The vibration analysis device would work by being attached to the consumer appliance.  It would use a combination of an accelerometer, to measure vibration, and a contact microphone, to measure sound. These measurements would be analyzed in a custom software that will be able to recognize any abnormalities in vibration or sound. That way, if the appliance begins to show signs of an imminent breakdown, the device will alert the user.


# Outcome
The anticipated outcome is a relatively small device, around 5”x5”, that can easily be attached to a consumer appliance, connected to a power supply, and easily configured with a user-friendly software. This software could connect to a phone and send notification alerts when the device senses abnormalities in the appliance. The device would ideally serve a wide range of consumers and work with most home appliances, such as washing/drying machines, refrigerators, AC units, and more.
